"# BasicCL: Implementations of some basic algorithms in CL/NLP" 

Implementations are meant for "toy problems", of which the results are for us to check our "pen-and-paper" solutions against. No guarantee entails.

Please refer to the "examples.ipynb" notebook for some working examples of the functions.
